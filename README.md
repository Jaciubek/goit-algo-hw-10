Homework description

Task 1. Optimization of production

The company produces two types of beverages: "Lemonade" and "Fruit juice". Different ingredients and a limited amount of equipment are used to produce these beverages. The objective is to maximize production given the limited resources.

Problem Conditions:

"Lemonade is made from Water, Sugar, and Lemon Juice.
"Fruit juice" is made from "Fruit puree" and "Water".
Resource limitations: 100 units of "Water", 50 units of "Sugar", 30 units of "Lemon Juice" and 40 units of "Fruit Puree".
Producing a unit of Lemonade requires 2 units of Water, 1 unit of Sugar, and 1 unit of Lemon Juice.
The production of a unit of Fruit Juice requires 2 units of Fruit Puree and 1 unit of Water.


Using PuLP, create a model that determines how much Lemonade and Fruit Juice should be produced to maximize the total number of products while respecting the resource constraints. Write a program whose code maximizes the total number of Lemonade and Fruit Juice products produced, given the resource constraints.



Task 2. Calculate the definite integral

Your second task is to calculate the value of the integral of a function using the Monte Carlo method.

 ðŸ“– You can choose the function at your discretion.

Let's build a graph.
